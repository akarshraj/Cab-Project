# Cab-Project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A) Abstract:-
      A Cab Booking System built using Java Swing components is developed with the aid of in-built data structures like array lists and hash maps.
      The project includes a Java GUI application that acts as a cab booking system wherein the customer is supposed to enter his/her details 
      namely name, contact number, pickup location and drop location. 

B) Layout:-
      The first page is our "Welcome" Page, 
                          wherein you are asked whether you want to go to the "driver's section" or to the "booking" section.
      In "Driver's section", 
                          the driver has to chose his id number to check his status and details.
      In "Passenger's Section", 
                          we need to fill in our details if we are not already a registered member and we are, then directly surf in to book the cab.

C) Working:-
      1. Based on the location, a driver from our driver list who is closest to the calling customer is chosen and is sent to the cutomer's location.
      2. On reaching the customer's current location, the driver's location is set to this location and he manually has to set his status to "busy".
      3. After dropping the cutomer, his location is set to the current location ie. the drop location.
